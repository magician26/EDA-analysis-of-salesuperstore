**Repository Name: Superstore_Sales_EDA**

**Description:**

Superstore_Sales_EDA is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on sales data from a superstore. This repository contains Python code that analyzes various aspects of the sales dataset using popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization of sales trends, segmentation analysis, and more.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling of date formats, checking for duplicates, and converting data types.
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Visualizes the frequency distribution of sales segments and calculates the mean sales per segment.
- **Category and Sub-category Analysis**: Examines the sales performance across different categories and sub-categories of products.
- **Top Products Analysis**: Identifies and visualizes the top-selling products in the superstore.
- **Shipment Mode Analysis**: Analyzes the sales distribution based on different shipment modes.
- **Delivery Time Analysis**: Investigates the distribution of delivery days and their impact on sales.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualizes sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly insights.

**Getting Started:**

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
3. Run the provided Python script on your dataset or use the sample dataset provided.
4. Explore the code and visualizations to gain insights into the sales data.
